# Summary

This repository contains a collection of "Dockerfile" for their respective automated build in Docker hub,
found at https://hub.docker.com/u/picoded/

# Note

That gradually overtime, I would be refactoring these various file to a more structured format

# Organized Dockerfile

See their respective README for more details. These Dockerfile, typically represents various iterations,
of all my DevOps docker experiences. Refined for multiple use cases.

+ base
	+ ubuntu-base

# Unorganized Dockerfile

Every other folder not in organized Dockerfile, these ranges from awesome, to crap, to not working.

Even I was a noob once, and had to start from somewhere =P

# License 

`MIT License`

This is an obvious choice due to the highly public nature of these Docker repo's and how easy, 
or commonly can it be replicated, Where I wager that someone out there has something similar.

Hopefully mine is better, Cheers!
