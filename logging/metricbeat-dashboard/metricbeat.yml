  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path

    #param1: value1
    #param2: value2

  # Number of workers per Elasticsearch host.

  # requests are made.
  #flush_interval: 1s

  # Use SSL settings for HTTPS. Default is true.
  #ssl.enabled: true

  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts

  #pretty: false

#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag.
setup.dashboards.enabled: true

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

# The directory from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead of the URL
# when it has a value.
#setup.dashboards.directory:

# The file archive (zip file) from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead
# of the URL when it has a value.
#setup.dashboards.file:

# If this option is enabled, the snapshot URL is used instead of the default URL.
#setup.dashboards.snapshot: false

# The URL from where to download the snapshot version of the dashboards. By default
# this has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version.
#setup.dashboards.snapshot_url

# In case the archive contains the dashboards from multiple Beats, this lets you
# select which one to load. You can load all the dashboards in the archive by
# setting this to the empty string.
# setup.dashboards.beat: metricbeat

# The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. Default is ".kibana"
#setup.dashboards.kibana_index: .kibana

# The Elasticsearch index name. This overwrites the index name defined in the
# dashboards and index pattern. Example: testbeat-*
setup.dashboards.index: ${ES_PREFIX}*

#================================ Logging ======================================
# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windows systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: true

# If enabled, metricbeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# # Logging to rotating files files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# # files.
# logging.to_files: true
# logging.files:
#   # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
#   # under the home path (the binary location).
#   #path: /var/log/metricbeat

#   # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
#   #name: metricbeat

#   # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
#   # automatically rotated
#   #rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

#   # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
#   #keepfiles: 7
